# FScanR: an R package to detect Programmed Ribosomal Frameshifting (PRF) events from mRNA/cDNA

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/release%20version-0.99.4-green.svg)](https://github.com/seanchen607/FScanR)
[![Project Status: Active - The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#active)

‘FScanR’ identifies Programmed Ribosomal Frameshifting (PRF) events from BLASTX output 
in tab format containing the best hits of targeted mRNA/cDNA sequences against 
the peptide library of the same species or a close relative.

To acquire the input file with 14 columns in tab-delimited format, which is generated by BLASTX, parameters should be used for BLASTX: 

	-outfmt '6 qseqid sseqid pident length mismatch gapopen qstart qend sstart send evalue bitscore qframe sframe'

- From [*Mauger et al., 2013, FEBS Letters*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2013.03.002)

Ribosomal frameshifting, also known as translational frameshifting or translational recoding, is a biological phenomenon 
that occurs during translation that results in the production of multiple, unique proteins from a single mRNA. 
The process can be programmed by the nucleotide sequence of the mRNA and is sometimes affected by the secondary, 3-dimensional mRNA structure.
It has been described mainly in viruses (especially retroviruses), retrotransposons and bacterial insertion elements, and also in some cellular genes.
